Terms, tricks, and tools of Discord raiders; a concise delve into the Discord raiding community 

## 📝 Information
Discord is a messaging platform. On there exists a group of people who raid servers (places where people can talk with others) and/or people's DMs (direct messages) either for fun, as revenge, or something else. That group of people is slowly but surely dwindling as Discord tightens its grip around those who break their TOS, as raiding is against TOS. The main reason there's so many people who do such things on Discord is thanks to their weak API, and developers take advantage of that weak API — then those developers recruit low-skill people to work for them as raiders.

### Dictionary
All of these below are against Discord's TOS.
1. Spamming — Sending a message over and over again
2. Raiding — Spamming with the intent of disrupting the chat
3. Nuking — Destroying a server by deleting all the channels/roles, spamming new channels/roles, and so on; this action is usually done using a bot
4. Grabbing — Can refer to IP grabbing or token grabbing, and those I will not touch on much here
5. Selfbot — A program used to automate one's account

### Disclaimer
This repository was made to document the raiding community on Discord, and I did not intend for anything I'm saying to be used by people for malicious purposes. Some people may find this useless fighting against raiders.
